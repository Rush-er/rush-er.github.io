So this week i thought about the internet and i came up with an idea.

Let's start with something basic and simple before digging furthermore; internet is a place where you can find a lot of things like my **Instagram profile** nickname _Wasteland_ :P
[https://instagram.com.wasteland-user-link-url-ekcj1bx9defk3r17c73hske1like7rmnc31kcec.xyz](http://instagram.com.wasteland-user-link-url-ekcj1bx9defk3r17c73hske1like7rmnc31kcec.xyz)

> My personal profile

Let's start with the real thing, if you clicked on my **Instagram profile** URL you just get redirected to my blog page, let's find out why after a quick introduction to URLs.
### URL meaning and schema
URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. A URL is nothing more than the address of a given unique resource on the Web.

Nowadays it's really easy to get fooled with URLs, this happens because people don't know how a URL works;
for a URL to works you need:
1. Protocol
2. Domain
3. Path to file

After this we can proceed with an example.

Base URL [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_URL)
1. Protocol --> **https:**
2. Domain --> **developer[]().mozilla.org**
3. Path to file --> **/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_URL**

Now that you know the basics of URL we can take a look at my Instagram profile URL,
this is the URL: [https://instagram.com.wasteland-user-link-url-ekcj1bx9defk3r17c73hske1like7rmnc31kcec.xyz](http://instagram.com.wasteland-user-link-url-ekcj1bx9defk3r17c73hske1like7rmnc31kcec.xyz);
we can divide it like before:

1. Protocol --> **https:**
2. Domain --> **wasteland-user-link-url-ekcj1bx9defk3r17c73hske1like7rmnc31kcec[]().xyz**
3. Path to file --> Nothing !

In this case i manipulate my URL domain to act like as a normal _Path to file_, the **instagram[]().com** domain it's just a subdomain to my real domain.
After this you may think how to find the real domain of the URL, it's really simple, just find the last --> . <-- of the URL, after that you always find a TLD like **.com**, **.it**, **.org**, etcâ€¦

The domain name we used in the first example is divided like this

Label 2 in our exemple is the subdomain pointing to **instagram.com**

So after all this why my URL was bad ?
It was bad because i used it to redirect whatever i liked, in that case to my website; i could redirect to a copycat page of Instagram login for the purpose of stealing your info or do whatever i wanted.
